We'd like to clarify that currently, there is no ongoing development from our side for the app. However, in our commitment to fostering collaboration and improvement, we have decided to release the code of the app to the public. This means that anyone with the necessary skills and enthusiasm is welcome to contribute to the development of the app by adding the features they deem necessary.

We believe in the power of community-driven initiatives and look forward to seeing the app evolve with your contributions.
