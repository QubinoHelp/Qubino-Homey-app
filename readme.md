The developer documentation can be accessed at [Homey Apps SDK](https://apps.developer.homey.app/) We kindly advise reviewing it before initiating any modifications.

Further details regarding the Homey Z-Wave driver can be found [here](https://athombv.github.io/node-homey-zwavedriver/). 

Before you make any chenges to the code you have to install Node.js, NVM and Homey CLI (command line interface) you can find a guide on how to do that [here](https://apps.developer.homey.app/the-basics/getting-started).

After making changes to the code, you can ensure its functionality by testing it locally on your Homey device using the command **Homey App Run** in the terminal window.
